Skill Swap Platform ‚Äî AI-Powered (Odoo Hackathon 2025)

A full-stack Skill Sharing & Mentoring platform built for the Odoo Hackathon 2025.
It uses AI and semantic intelligence to match users for skill exchanges, recommend
learning paths, optimize availability, and more.

All features are modular, API-ready (FastAPI), and integrated with Git LFS for handling large model files.

Features Implemented

Skill Matching (Semantic)

Recommends compatible users by matching offered & wanted skills using Sentence-BERT.

Smart Skill Autocomplete

Suggests skill names using fuzzy matching and semantic similarity while typing.

Mutual Interest Matching

Computes match score based on both skill alignment and availability overlap.

Time-Slot Optimized Swapping

Prioritizes mentors/mentees who are free at the same time for smoother scheduling.

Suggested Learning Paths

Recommends next skills to learn based on current skills using embeddings + vector math.
